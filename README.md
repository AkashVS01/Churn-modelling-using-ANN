# Churn-prediction-using-ANN

Churn prediction aims to detect customers intended to leave a service provider.Here the prediction is done on bank customers.This modelling enables the companies or organisations to identify the areas where 
they lag behind, thereby enabling them to rectify those issues and also aid in 
increasing the retention rate. The 
machine learning technique used in this project is Artificial Neural 
Network without momentum.

## Dataset
The considered data set contains details of a bank's customers and the target 
variable is a binary variable reflecting the fact whether the customer leave the bank (closed 
his account) or he continues to be a customer. Dataset can be found in the repository or download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churnmodelling?select=Churn_Modelling.csv

## Results
Model that is built gives the training accuracy of 87% and a testing accuracy of 85%.
